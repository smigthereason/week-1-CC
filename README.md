## Project Description

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator(Toy Problem)

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks.//This is created using JS

The input should be between 0 and 100. Then Output the correct grade://This is created using HTML

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less than 40.//Using JS, one can apply the if-else conditional statement and apply DOM to bring the feedback on the browser for the client.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector(Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g80.//This is created using HTML

If the speed is less than 70, it should print “OK”.//if-else statement is applied.

Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. 

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator(Toy Problem)

Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
